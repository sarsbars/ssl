                    <p class="question">
                        What is SSL?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol that encrypts 
                        data transmitted between a web browser and a server, 
                        ensuring that sensitive information like passwords and 
                        credit card details stays private and secure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">
                        What is TLS?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol that 
                        ensures secure communication over the internet by 
                        encrypting data and verifying the identity of the 
                        parties involved. It is the successor to SSL, 
                        offering stronger encryption and improved security 
                        features for modern applications.

                    <p class="question">
                        How can I tell that my webpage is secure?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        You can tell your webpage is secure if the URL starts 
                        with "https://" instead of "http://" and there’s a 
                        padlock icon next to it in the browser’s address bar.
                        Clicking the padlock shows details about the website's 
                        security certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">
                        What does it mean to be secure?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        A secure webpage means the data you send and receive 
                        is encrypted, so it can't be easily read by hackers or
                        unauthorized people. It also verifies the website's 
                        identity to ensure you're communicating with the right 
                        site.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">
                        What is encryption and why do I care?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Encryption is a way of scrambling information so only 
                        the intended recipient can understand it, keeping it 
                        safe from hackers or eavesdroppers. You should care 
                        because it protects sensitive data like passwords, 
                        credit card numbers, and personal messages when using 
                        the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">
                        Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking
                        about secure websites?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes, the prefix matters, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
                        Protocol) sends data without encryption, making it less 
                        secure, while HTTPS (HTTP Secure) encrypts data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">
                        What is an SSL certificate authority?
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        An SSL Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted 
                        organization that issues SSL/TLS certificates 
                        to websites. These certificates validate the identity 
                        of the website and enable encrypted communication 
                        between the site and its visitors, ensuring that the 
                        website is legitimate and secure.
